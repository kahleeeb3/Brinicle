# Physical Model of Brinicle Growth Rate

# Introduction
A brinicle (brine icicle, also known as ice stalactite) is a downward-growing hollow tube of ice enclosing a plume of descending brine that is formed beneath developing sea ice. The main goal of this research is to build a simulation ofÂ Brinicles formation and analyze the length of the brinicle as a function of time.

# Growth Model
As found by Paul K Dayton and Seelye Martin in their research on [Observations of ice stalactites in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JC076i006p01595), the length of the brinicle as a function of time exhibits a

/> relationship such that:

where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\dpi{100}&space;\bg_black&space;\fn_jvn&space;\alpha"
